 * Total Submissions: 883.4K
 * Testcase Example:  '{"$id":"1","next":{"$id":"2","next":null,"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":2},"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":1}'
 *
 * A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random
 * pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.
 * 
 * Return a deep copy of the list.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * 
 * {"$id":"1","next":{"$id":"2","next":null,"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":2},"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":1}
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * Node 1's value is 1, both of its next and random pointer points to Node 2.
 * Node 2's value is 2, its next pointer points to null and its random pointer
 * points to itself.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * You must return the copy of the given headÂ as a reference to the cloned
 * list.

// Consider l1 as a node on the 1st list and l2 as the corresponding node on 2nd list.
// Step 1:
// Build the 2nd list by creating a new node for each node in 1st list. 
// While doing so, insert each new node after it's corresponding node in the 1st list.
// Step 2:
// The new head is the 2nd node as that was the first inserted node.
// Step 3:
// Fix the random pointers in the 2nd list: (Remember that l1->next is actually l2)
// l2->random will be the node in 2nd list that corresponds l1->random, 
// which is next node of l1->random.
// Step 4:
// Separate the combined list into 2: Splice out nodes that are part of second list. 
// Return the new head that we saved in step 2.
