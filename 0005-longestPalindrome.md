#Describe
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:

Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

### Manacher's algorithm
* abcdf ==> #a#b#c#d#f and use each character as center to check both sides.
```python
class Solution:
    #Manacher algorithm
    #http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_palindromic_substring
    
    def longestPalindrome(self, s):
        # Transform S into T.
        # For example, S = "abba", T = "^#a#b#b#a#$".
        # ^ and $ signs are sentinels appended to each end to avoid bounds checking
        T = '#'.join('^{}$'.format(s))
        n = len(T)
        P = [0] * n
        C = R = 0
        for i in range (1, n-1):
            P[i] = (R > i) and min(R - i, P[2*C - i]) # equals to i' = C - (i-C)
            # Attempt to expand palindrome centered at i
            while T[i + 1 + P[i]] == T[i - 1 - P[i]]:
                P[i] += 1
    
            # If palindrome centered at i expand past R,
            # adjust center based on expanded palindrome.
            if i + P[i] > R:
                C, R = i, i + P[i]
    
        # Find the maximum element in P.
        maxLen, centerIndex = max((n, i) for i, n in enumerate(P))
        return s[(centerIndex  - maxLen)//2: (centerIndex  + maxLen)//2]

### Navie check and update
* check every character and every gap between characters
```python
def longestPalindrome(self, s):
    res = ""
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # odd case, like "aba"
        tmp = self.helper(s, i, i)
        if len(tmp) > len(res):
            res = tmp
        # even case, like "abba"
        tmp = self.helper(s, i, i+1)
        if len(tmp) > len(res):
            res = tmp
    return res
 
# get the longest palindrome, l, r are the middle indexes   
# from inner to outer
def helper(self, s, l, r):
    while l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:
        l -= 1; r += 1
    return s[l+1:r]
